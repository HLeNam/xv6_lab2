The value a7 = 0x7 in xv6 corresponds to the syscall number that a process wants to invoke. 
Specifically:
a7 = 0x7 is the syscall number for SYS_exec in xv6, meaning that the exec system call will be executed. This syscall is used to replace the current program with a new one.

num = * (int *) 0;  a3

In the RISC-V system, address 0 is typically not mapped in the page table of the kernel. This means that any attempt to access address 0 will result in a memory access error (segmentation fault).
In the previous result, the value of scause printed is 0xd. According to the RISC-V definition, this value indicates an invalid memory access error (Load Page Fault).
The sepc (Saved Program Counter) points to the location of the assembly instruction that caused the error, in this case: lw a3, 0(zero). This is a load instruction that attempts to load a value from address 0, leading to a memory access fault.
